# Dudas CLI Tools
A set of tools for working with PATFT data. Very much a work in progress. Tools do not require third party libraries. Created using: `ruby 2.1.4p265 (2014-10-27 revision 48166) [x86_64-darwin14.0]`

## Current toolchain:

* `download`: pipe a list of patents (e.g., "patents.list") and get a list of HTML source (see patents.out for a sample, basically it's one HTML file per line)
* `parse`: pipe in output of download and (for now) get a list of patent numbers and titles

Example: `cat patents.list | ./download | ./parse > titles.out`

Example: `./download patents.list | ./parse > titles.out`

## Immediate work

* ‚ùóÔ∏è Parse should default to a certain format (JSON?)
* ‚ùóÔ∏è Fill in the rest of the patent details
* ‚ÄºÔ∏è Testing (esp. with respect to regex)
* üòé Use method_missing? instead of individual getter methods
* üòé Clean up structure of `parse`
